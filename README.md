# Academy Theme

Reusable Hugo theme module that powers the Layer5 Academy. This module provides
the layouts, shortcodes, and partials to get academy up and running.

## Getting Started

The recommended approach to use this theme is through the
[academy starter template](https://github.com/layer5io/academy-example).

For comprehensive documentation, visit the
[official Academy documentation](https://docs.layer5.io/cloud/academy/).

## Content Structure

The Academy uses the following content hierarchy:

### Learning Path → Course → Module

In addition to this core structure, the following content types are available:

- **Lab** - Hands-on practical exercises
- **Challenge** - Skill assessment challenges
- **Test** - Knowledge assessments (test, optional-test,
  final-test)
- **Certification** - Certification programs

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Deprecated Features**

- The `usestatic` shortcode is deprecated and should not be used in new
  content.
